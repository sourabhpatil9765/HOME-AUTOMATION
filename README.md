# HOME-AUTOMATION
AUTOMATE THE HOME APPLIANCES

This project presents a design and prototype implementation of new home 
automation system that uses Wi-Fi technology as a network infrastructure 
connecting its parts. The proposed system consists of two main components; the first part is the server (web server), which presents system core that 
manages, controls, and monitors usersâ€™ home. 

Users and system administrator can locally (LAN) or remotely (internet)  
manage and control system code. Second part is hardware interface module, 
which provides appropriate interface to sensors and actuator of home 
automation system. 
Unlike most of available home automation system in the market the proposed system is scalable that one server can manage many hardware interface modules as long as it exists on Wi-Fi network coverage. System supports a wide range of home automation devices like power management components, and security components. 
The proposed system is better from the scalability and flexibility point of view than the commercially available home automation systems.
